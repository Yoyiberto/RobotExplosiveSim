# Robotic Simulation for Automated Explosive Placement in Mining

This project showcases a robotic simulation created in RoboDK to explore the feasibility of automating explosive placement in mining operations. The primary goal is to validate a system where a robotic arm, mounted on a mobile truck, can precisely and safely position explosive charges on a mine face.

## The Simulation

The simulation demonstrates a UR robotic arm integrated onto a truck platform. The robot executes a program to pick individual explosive charges from a tray and accurately place them into pre-drilled holes on a rock wall. This process is central to preparing a site for blasting.

The system is designed to prove that automating this hazardous task is viable, aiming to enhance safety, improve precision, and increase operational efficiency in challenging mining environments.
